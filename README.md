# premodiALS

Made by Clara Meijs

INTRODUCTION:
The data collection of the premodiALS project is still ongoing. All the code you will find in this folder is code that I wrote for analysing pilot data to decide on analysis techniques. So for example which protocol to use. For each data type that I received from each lab, I presented the results of the preliminary analyses in the Â±bi-monthly predmodiALS update meetings.
